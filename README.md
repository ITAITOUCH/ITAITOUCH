👋 Hi there! I'm a dedicated Penetration Tester with a rich background in cybersecurity. My journey has been built on a solid foundation acquired through diverse roles in the IT and security realm. I have a deep-seated passion for diving into the intricacies of Linux/Unix operating systems, especially Ubuntu and Kali Linux, and I'm not afraid to wield PowerShell and automation scripts to streamline processes.

💻 My heart beats for Web Application Penetration Testing. There's something thrilling about uncovering and mitigating vulnerabilities, with the OWASP top 10 guiding my every move. My quest for knowledge led me to advanced training at PortSwigger Academy, where I honed my skills, and countless CTF challenges, where I put them to the test.

🛠️ I pride myself on my expertise with powerhouse PT tools like Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nessus, and my adeptness at OSINT methodologies. These tools are not just part of my arsenal; they're extensions of my curiosity and commitment to securing the digital landscape.

🖥️ Beyond penetration testing, I've ensured the security and resilience of IT infrastructures, managing Windows Server environments, Active Directory, and navigating the complexities of DC and DNS with ease.
